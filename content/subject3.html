    <h3>&nbsp;The main focus in these classes was using Java with the IntelliJ IDE.<br>
        We made many exercises lists to practice and comprehend programming basic logics and functions.</h3>
    <h3>&nbsp;My repositore contains 6 entire lists with an pdf explaning what is required in each one, plus commentaries into the program.<br></h3>

<!--Program Explanation - Class Main-->
<div id="mainJCode" style="padding-top: 5%;">
    <div class="card3">
        <p>The main starts normally, importing libraries and instancing the player and others objects</p>
        <p>How the history is like you're in the end of an adventure, i used the random class to pick in an range to health, strength and defense, to simulate you've passed a lot of battles</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 20%;"><p>A bit of story to context the player...</p></div>
    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 5%;">
        <p>The battle consists in turns, so the principle of the code is: your move, the boss's move and then an function to analyse the state of the battle, if you died, if the boss died, etc </p>
        <p>Now and further in this code, i utilize the outerloop system to be able to choose when i want to simply restart an loop or if i want to break this loop</p>
