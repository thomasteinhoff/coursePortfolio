    <h3>&nbsp;The main focus in these classes was using Java with the IntelliJ IDE.<br>
        We made many exercises lists to practice and comprehend programming basic logics and functions.</h3>
    <h3>&nbsp;My repositore contains 6 entire lists with an pdf explaning what is required in each one, plus commentaries into the program.<br></h3>

        <h3>Here we can see the classes i created to this game. Turning the player and boss into objects granted me an easier way to manipulate it atributes, the "parryWindow" is also an object, but we gonna se it more further.</h3>
        <h3>&nbsp;By now, heres the full explained <button id="buttonMainJCode" class="cardInTextbutton" onclick="toggleMainJCode()">Main</button></h3>

<!--Program Explanation - Class Main-->
<div id="mainJCode" class="codeExplanationPL" style="padding-top: 2%;">
    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 2%;">
        <p>The main starts normally, importing libraries and instancing the player and others objects, the player class requires signatures since you choose your name, the other stats are auto filled</p>
        <p>How the history is like you're in the end of an adventure, i used the random class to pick in an range to health, strength and defense, to simulate you've passed a lot of battles</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 20%;">
        <p>The story is told in the console, certain points is required a response of the player to progress, empty scanners serves to prevent the code to continue. That while loop exists to prevent the story to continue until the player agrees with the condition he is told</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 2%;">
        <p>The battle consists in turns, so the principle of the code is: your move, the boss's move and then an function to analyse the state of the battle: if you died, if the boss died, etc </p>
        <p>Now and further in this code, i utilize the outerloop system to be able to choose when i want to simply restart an loop or if i want to break and continue with the code</p>
        <p>How the turns are based in pre determinated choises, to both opponents, i turned them into functions, by doing so i can keep the loop clean and functional</p>
        <p>A switch case interprets how the battle is going in basis of a number the checkBattleState() return to it</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 20%;">
        <p>By speaking of the functions, i have some others that also help me through the code</p>
        <p>The 𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘥 function serve to quickly pick a number in a range i choose in the signature</p>
        <p>The 𝘥𝘦𝘭𝘢𝘺 uses the native 𝘴𝘭𝘦𝘦𝘱 fucntion to make the routine wait a certain period</p>
        <p>And the 𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘤𝘬𝘉𝘢𝘵𝘵𝘭𝘦𝘚𝘵𝘢𝘵𝘦 whose undergoes a series of comparasions that return the state of the battle, the condition is treated in the main loop </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 2%;">
        <p>The boss uses an stagger system, which is basically an endurance attribute, each attack increases it's value, the functions reads it and actuate according to. Example: if it passes 100 points, the boss faint and reveals a weak spot</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 20%;">
        <p>Another series of tests and the boss acts accordingly to an algorithm, attacking, preparing the attack, etc...</p>
        <p>Some parts of the code utilizes try/catches in sensitive code whose may crash the routine</p>
        <p>In this case the latch is used to the delay, it's required to the parry window to response properly to the code</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 22%;">
        <p>The player moveset is not too diferent, here we can see the use of a switch case reading the player input</p>
        <p>You can also see that the switch is inside an outerloop, the idea is to handle wrong inputs and to the player be able to rethink his actions, its easier than recursivity and grants a satisfatory responsivity</p>
        <p>The code utilizes various getters from the classes to determine the player options</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card1" style="padding: 10px 40px; margin-top: 20%; margin-left: 70%; display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: end; width: fit-content; gap: 5px;">

<!--Program Explanation - Class Main-->

<!--Buttons-->
<div class="card4">
    <button id="buttonCharJCode" class="cardGridItem" onclick="toggleCode('charJCode', 'codeCharJ')"><h2>Character</h2></button>
    <button id="buttonBossJCode" class="cardGridItem" onclick="toggleCode('bossJCode', 'codeBossJ')"><h2>Boss</h2></button>
    <button id="buttonParryJCode" class="cardGridItem" onclick="toggleCode('parryJCode', 'codeParryJ')"><h2>Parry</h2></button>
</div>

<!--Program Explanation - Class Char-->
<div id="charJCode" class="codeExplanationPL" style="padding-top: 10%;">
    <div class="card3">
        <p>The atributes and the rest of the methods are inicalized following the good pratices of classes formatation, which is each thing is commented in the code</p>
        <p>How some of the values are already generated in the main, they are added as signature normally</p>
        <p>Some of the attributes are fix to the start of the run, so they are insancied independently</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 18%;"><p>Constructing the class...</p></div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 15%;">
        <p>Getters and setter are most of the methods used, the logic are pre determinated in the main, so manipulating the values are more than suficient</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 20%;">
        <p>The heal function utilizes a Math library command to cap the amount you can heal</p>
        <p>Here is utilized an Override to replace the standart 𝘵𝘰𝘚𝘵𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘨 to a little text suitable to the game</p>
    </div>
</div>

<!--Program Explanation - Class Boss-->
<div id="bossJCode" class="codeExplanationPL" style="padding-top: 12%;">
    <div class="card3">
        <p>In terms of capsulation, we can see that in all classes the attributes are private to protect outsiders mess with then, if you analyse, the methods and getters are all public in this project since they don't necessary need to be private, all getters and setters are common between the char and boss and more specific methods handle unique attriubtes in the classes, so they're not usable in another objects anyway</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 5%;">
        <p>The boss doesn't have any attribute that may variate, so the constructor doesn't have any signature and starts with standart values</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 33%;">
        <p>Here's a simple decision process to check if the player has checked the boss status or not yet</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 25%;"><p>The rest of the methods is not much different from the Character class</p></div>
</div>

<!--Program Explanation - Class Parry-->
<div id="parryJCode" class="codeExplanationPL" style="padding-top: 17%;">
    <div class="card3">
        <p>First i import some librarires in the class, since they are not used in the main code, like the timer functions and the awt to the window features</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 10%;"><p>We hair the JFrame class and create the attributes</p></div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 15%;">
        <p>The constructor administrate the window and the latch, which i call to pause the main run while the player interage with the parry window</p>
        <p>The super works as a constructor, the signature is the name that will show in the window tab</p>
        <p>The size, behavior when closed and location are also determinated here</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 34%;">
        <p>Here is prepared a function, where a button is created, it also determinate what happens when clicked: flags the parry, end the latch and dispose the window</p>
        <p>Just after this the function is called</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 20%;">
        <p>While the window is created and functionate, this part of the code, inside the latch continues</p>
        <p>Another function of a timer is created, where counts up to 2 seconds</p>
        <p>If the button previously created is pressed, it ends the latch and the timer is ignored, if not, at the end of the timer, itself end the latch, the window and flags the parry as false</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 5%;"><p>An unique getter is used, to verify the state of the parry</p></div>

    <div class="card3" style="margin-top: 26%;">
        <p>This class only function is to create a new latch which runs what you just read</p>
    </div>

</div>
