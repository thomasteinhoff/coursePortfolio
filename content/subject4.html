    <h3>&nbsp;With the PotsgreSQL we studied and created relational databases, which are those organized in interrelated tables with a fixed schema and predefined formats.</h3>
    <h3>&nbsp;This type of database uses single commands based on queries, which are also separated into three main groups (there are other more specific groups)</h3>

    <h2 style="color: #FFE6C7;">Normalization</h2>
    <h3>&nbsp;Normalization is the process of organizing data in relational databases to minimize redundancy and ensure integrity by dividing it into smaller, more cohesive tables.</h3>
    <h3 style="color: #FFE6C7;">&nbsp;First Normal Form (1FN):</h3>
    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliminates redundancy by ensuring that each value is atomic and that each column has a unique name, simplifying query and update operations.</h3>
    <h3 style="color: #FFE6C7;">&nbsp;Second Normal Form (2FN):</h3>
    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliminates partial dependencies by requiring each column to depend completely on the primary key, reducing data manipulation anomalies.</h3>
    <h3 style="color: #FFE6C7;">&nbsp;Third Normal Form (3FN):</h3>
    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliminates transitive dependencies, ensuring that each non-key attribute depends only on the primary key, which simplifies maintenance and reduces redundancy.</h3>
